# Fortnite Dataset

This Dataset contains extrapolated network packet traces as well as generated
player movement patterns. The extrapolated traces were generated based on
observations of real network traffic.

The first version of this repository only contains the Data of a single
generated game. As soon as the corresponding paper is accepted for presentation,
additional game rounds as well as python scripts for the generation of other
rounds and for customization of this data are added.
