# Fortnite Dataset

In this repository, we provide extrapolated network packet traces as well as generated
player movement patterns of the online game Fortnite. The extrapolated traces were generated based on
observations of real network traffic.

Sample traces of one game round can be found in the folder `GeneratedTraces`. Tools to generate traces for an arbitrary number of games can be found in the `Tools` folder.

A visualization of the generated movement traces of the game round `g0` can be found on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QhVJy3fsPw

If you use scripts or traces from this repository for your research, we kindly ask to cite our paper:
